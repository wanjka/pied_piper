# Pied Pipper
*Work in progress...*
Remember the 'Silicon valley' first episode?
This project tries to realize what the main character did on purpose
and that is to create a site that will check how original is your music,
it does this by using the notes with the big database of various compositions
(we have collected from different resources) and finds similar ones.
